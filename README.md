Team Meeting Friday June 24 @ Sinclair Library
Chad, Gary and Allen are working on the report

Starting with the Use of Approved tools, team decided to use a table.
Will be using HTML to code the webpage for the assignment.
Group is working together on the deprecated functions and alternatives for the functions

Our webpage will feature two types of user functions. The first will be short term
This will allow the user to look at shorter term monetary goals.
For example, they will have top out, which will show them how long it will take for them 
to reach a certain value. Another will be Pay Off Debt. This will show them how long it
will take to pay off a certain debt. 

Long Term functions will be the second type of user functions. This will show the inflation
of the users money for a fixed amount of years. The interest option will show the user how much 
is gained over a fixed amount of years.
